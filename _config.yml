  Iâ€™m a postdoc at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology in Japan.
  I did my Ph.D. at the University of Technology Sydney between 2017-22 under the supervision of Marco Tomamichel and Chris Ferrie.
  My broad research interests lie at the intersection of quantum information theory and quantum physics.
  I share some stuff [here](https://kafkaishramble.wordpress.com/) but infrequently.
